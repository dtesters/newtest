Starting June 18, you might notice members of your server bringing new fun, games, and functionality to your space with apps.\n\nWe launched a new feature that allows anyone to add apps to their own account, and use them across all of their servers, DMs, and GDMs.\n\nCheck out our [Help Center article](<https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/23957313048343>) to learn about how you can effectively moderate apps in your server, including:\n\n- What these apps can (and can’t) do\n- How to set up our new “**Use External Apps”** permission, available now\n- How we leveled up AutoMod to keep your server safe\n\nWanna spend some time tinkering? Follow our [guide to building your own app](<https://discord.com/developers/docs/tutorials/developing-a-user-installable-app>)!\n\nStay awesome,\nThe Discord Team",

Starting May 15, it's possible you might notice something new next to some of your members' usernames: ✨ **Guild Tags **✨\n\nSee a cute little tag next to a member's username or profile? That's a **Guild Tag**, which indicates someone's membership to a chosen Guild. You can click on this tag to see the Guild profile, and even apply for membership there as well. What this means for you, beloved Admins and Mods, is that if your server's AutoMod is on, it will also check for Guild Tags ☑️ \n\n**What's a Guild?** It's a small, exclusive server that members can apply to join. These servers are tight-knit communities where members can relish in shared identities, hobbies, play styles, and more! \n> Please note that Guilds are only available to a small number of servers at this time, so not every server has access to this experiment. Additionally, our support team cannot manually add servers to this experiment.\n\nMuch love,\nThe Discord Team",

We have streamlined our policies and made updates to better align with our payment providers’ policies. This includes prohibiting monetization of gambling-adjacent activities such as gambling discussions, gambling advice, or community management of gambling operations.\n\nIf you decide to fully remove the ability to earn money through Server Monetization from your server, first make sure the following are true:\n- **All existing tiers are deleted** (Delete all draft and/or archived tiers as well). Your subscription(s) will roll off and cancel at the end of their cycles if your tiers are deleted.\n- **There are zero pending payouts.** If you’re waiting for a payout from Discord, you will need to wait until the final payout clears in the next cycle before Server Monetization can be fully removed from your server.\n\nOnce the above statements are true, you can follow [these steps to fully remove Server Subscriptions from your server](https://creator-support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10423011974551-Server-Shop-For-Server-Owners-and-Admins#h_01HHG1XZR121GMPN8CGF9T5MQR). \n\nThanks for helping us make Discord the best place for people to hang out and talk together!",

        "content": "# Discord Communities are Getting a Safety Buff 🦺\n\nToday, we're rolling out **three** new features that will help you keep your communities safe from DM spam and raids: **Activity Alerts, Security Actions, and a revamped Members page**.\n\n## Activity Alerts and Security Actions\n**Activity Alerts** will notify you of abnormal server behavior, particularly massive raids or unusual DM activity. From there, your team can investigate further and take further action to protect your community as necessary. If it doesn’t seem like an issue, you can easily mark it as safe. \n\n**Security Actions** allow swift server lockdowns by surfacing useful tools quicker, helping halt new member joins or aiding in closing off DMs between non-friend community members. Current Security Actions include:\n- **Pause Invites**: Stop new members from using any invites to join the server. Experienced moderators may know this one already, and now it’s more easily accessible.\n- **Pause DMs**: Temporarily stops new DMs from being sent between members in the server. This excludes friends DMing each other, when moderators DM server members, or DMs from Apps.\n\n## Members Page\nPreviously tucked away in Server Settings, the **Members page** is used to find specific members, display members with a specific role, and even help you prune inactive members. \n\nNow, the Members page is in a more easily-accessible spot above your server’s channel list. And it’s been reimagined, letting you view your members in a more organized manner.  It now displays relevant safety information about your members:\n- **Join Date**:  See when they joined your server.\n- **Invite Link**: See which invite link they used to join your server.\n- **Account Age**: See if they’ve been on Discord for a while or are a new user.\n- **Signals**: Appears if someone may have been engaging in unusual DM Activity, or flags a member you’ve timed out. Use this to easily filter and find members who might require additional action or review. Over time, we plan on surfacing additional relevant Signals.\n\nAll of these new features work in tandem to provide mods with the helpful information and actions needed to help squash DM spam and thwart raids. We’re committed to improving safety on Discord by empowering and equipping mods with more tools to help protect your servers from harmful disruptions. It’s a never-ending journey, so stay tuned—the best is yet to come!\n\nFor the details on how to use these new tools, check out the following articles in our help center:\n\n[Members page Help Center Article](<https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/15946797617431>)\n\n[Activity Alerts + Security Actions Help Center Article](<https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/17439993574167>)",

Today's spotlight introduces new features that help keep your communities cleaner from spam, and a preview into our early plans on building tools to deal with raids.\n\n<:automod:978473808623194143> **Keep your Community clean from spam with new AutoMod spam filters**\nWe know dealing with spammy messages sucks. If *only* there was a way spammy messages could be blocked from being posted in your channels and threads in the first place… \n\nThankfully, every community’s best friend in moderation - **AutoMod** - just got buffed with some new spam-cleansing abilities. Enable AutoMod in **Server Settings > AutoMod** to save hours of moderation work with these new filters:\n<:dot:890738617130037318>**Block Mention Spam** - Detect and block mention spam and mention raids before they happen to keep chat clean and prevent members in your community from receiving annoying mention notifications and ghost pings. Set your own limit on the number of mentions a message may contain (up to 50). \n<:dot:890738617130037318> **Block Spam Content** - Detect and block messages containing text content that has been widely flagged as spam by user reports. Great for blocking unwanted spam like those pesky free Nitro scams, unsolicited advertisements, and invite spam that disrupt your Community's friendly conversations and game nights.\nCheck out our updated AutoMod FAQ help article: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4421269296535-AutoMod-FAQ\n\n**Our early plans and progress to protect communities from raids**\nWe know being raided is one of the worst experiences you and your Community can go through which is why we’re giving you a heads up that we’re exploring ways to better detect and prevent raids before they take place, while making it easier to de-escalate a raid when they do happen.\n\nWhile we’re in the earlier stages of progress here at Discord Labs™, rest assured we’re eager to equip you with effective tools to more easily deal with raids as quickly as we can. So what can you do now?\n<:dot:890738617130037318> **Report Raids**: You can now directly send us feedback reports when a raid is taking place in your server by going to your Server Dropdown and selecting Report Raid. If your Community is being raided, we encourage you to partner with us in our moderation efforts by reporting the situation as we’ll be regularly reviewing your raid reports to develop tooling that combat raids. \n<:dot:890738617130037318> **Pause invitations** to your Community at anytime - You can now pause your invite links for when you want to temporarily prevent people from joining your server without having to revoking your invite links or vanity URLs - just head over to **Server Settings > Invites**. \nBecause this cuts off the flow of new arrivals, you'll have an easier time halting a raid in progress. It also lets well-intentioned community members trying to join know that the stoppage is temporary, and that soon, they’ll be able to come back to the same link and try again.\nLearn more about pausing invites: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/8458903738647\n\n**How we’re protecting communities from suspicious links: **\nTo help y’all with the legwork in dealing with messages containing malicious links, we’ve buffed every Community server with a proactive suspicious link filter designed to detect and block messages containing links that are verified to be harmful, such as those leading to malware or phishing sites that try to steal people’s personal or financial information. We’ll be continuously working on identifying links that might mislead or redirect users by reviewing a regularly updated list of unsafe and phishing websites: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/7326747355159-Why-was-my-message-not-delivered-",

Head over to **Server Setting > Community overview** and join us — we've got a slew of exciting and fun stuff planned that you won’t want to miss out on.\n\n🪴 __*Below is a sneak peek at the Stage events we’ve got cookin’!*__\n\n<:dot:958824443445116960> August 16th: Safety on Discord\n<:dot:958824443445116960> August 25th: Utilizing Automod in your Community\n\nTo join our Discord Admin Community, your server will need to hit a few engagement requirements. Once your community reaches the requirements listed <https://dis.gd/DAC-FAQ>, any of your Admins or Moderators with the “Manage Server” permission will be able to join the Discord Admin Community via Server Settings > Community.\n\n📚 __**Community Resources**__\nWe recently released our Community Resources, a one-stop shop for learning how to build, engage, grow, and manage a space where anyone can belong. New articles, showcases, and more will be added in the future, so be sure to bookmark it for later. <https://dis.gd/Community_Resources>\n\nIf you haven't already taken a peek at some of our content, you can check out the latest video! https://dis.gd/H2M_Your_Discord_Community\n\n🤖 **__Apps & Bots__**\nIf your server uses a **verified app**, the way you send commands has probably changed in the last year - if it hasn’t, it may very soon! Developers of verified apps have been migrating to Slash Commands. The deadline to finish migrating is the end of August, which means on Sept 1, any apps that haven’t finished may have reduced functionality.\n\nIf you haven’t tried out slash commands yet, type / in your server to see all the commands you have access to. If your favorite app isn’t listed, they may not yet have enabled slash commands. Or, you might need to check out the new permissions system in **Server Settings > Integrations.**\n\nIf you run across any issues, you can reach out to individual app developers to find out more.

Hopefully these updates are valuable in helping you build and create world class communities here on Discord.\n\n**⭐ __Custom Role Icons__**\n\nWe’ve just introduced our newest perk to **Level 2 Boosting - custom role icons**, which gives you a fun way to customize and distinguish roles in your server. You’ll be able to see this new feature on both desktop and mobile, but you’ll need to use desktop to set, change, or delete icons for now!\n\nIcons for each role will display in the members list and next to each member's name in chat, and you can see all icons associated with your roles in your user profile within the server. The role icon that shows next to someone's name in chat is from their highest role (according to Server Settings > Roles hierarchy).\n\nHave more questions? Check our Help Center article here: https://dis.gd/customroleiconsFAQ\n\n**<:boost:893279428598173747>__New Boost Level Pricing__**\n\nWe've reduced the number of boosts for Levels 2 and 3 in Server Boosting by half thanks to feedback from our community. Your servers now need 7 boosts to reach Level 2 and 14 boosts to hit Level 3. It’s possible that at this new price point your server may already be at a new level. You can see what those new perks are under Server Name > Server Boost.\n\n**📆 __Coming Soon: Scheduled Events__**\n\nWe’ve just started to roll out a new feature: Scheduled Events. This will allow you to plan ahead and schedule events in Voice or Stage channels as well as a free-form option for events being hosted outside of Discord (link or address) or in a text channel. \n\nThis will be rolling out to 100% of servers over the next few weeks so be on the lookout. For more information check out our Help Center article here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409494125719\n\n**<:serverdiscovery:893279664506798130>  __New Discovery Eligibility__**\n\nServer Discovery member requirement has now dropped from ~~7000~~ to **1000 members.** You can go to \"Server Settings\" > \"Discovery\" to check if your server is now eligible. \n\n**<:stagechannel:826978986340253726> __Sunset of Stage Discovery__**\n\nFinally, we’ve spent some time assessing our latest feature Stage Discovery and where best to serve our communities moving forward. We have made the decision that **we will be sunsetting Stage Discovery starting on October 4th.** For more info on why we’ve made this decision and what’s to come for communities for the rest of the year check out our latest blog post here: https://discord.com/blog/whats-next-for-communities-at-discord",

Learn the basics in the Threads FAQ Help Center Article here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423\n    - We have three new permissions to help you fine-tune which members can create threads, and which channels Threads can be made in. Learn more here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404809613847\n    - We’re initially slow rolling out Threads on Discord, while we monitor performance, but hope to get it to all servers by end of the week. \n\n⚠️ __**Important**__ ⚠️ \nFor now, Threads will not be enabled by default for Community servers. However, once you get access, you will have a new server settings tab on the web or in your client called **“Threads Early Access.”** \n\nFrom there, you can turn on Threads by clicking “Enable Threads,” and customize your Thread permissions for your community (e.g. enable in specific channels or disable for certain roles). \n\n**Otherwise, on August 17th, Thread permissions will be default-on for all Community servers too. **\n\nHappy 🧵ing!",
